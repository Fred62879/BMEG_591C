- wave
transverse wave is what we used

- s5
entry of muller is complex
entry of jones is real

- s6
in practice we cannot detect imaginary part
we thus only care about real part (cos function)
justifies why we use cos

- s7
phase
kz is a pair
wt is a pair (w is angular freq)

info about t can help infer about w but nothing about kz

(when take fourier transform of t we can get electro of w)

- s8
complex numbers
cos is real term, sin is imaginary term

- s9
eulers
abs (complex)
|a e^{i\phi} | = \sqrt(~^2) = A

A is amplitude, phi is phase

E(z,t) = Re{~} just means the real part of the thing inside {}

- s10
complex conjugate
ae^j\phi -> ae^-j\phi
cos() + j sin() -> cos() - j sin()

used to accelerate convolution (flip

cross correlation (register two images taken at different time)

- spectrum
c = lambda * mu is constant
large lambda gives small mu (speed)


- fourier gaussian
narrow gaussian to broad gaussian
broad gaus to narrow gaus

this works like      intensity on screen
rectangular func     follow distribution like F(w)

similarlay, if pinhole is gaussian, the screen also shows gaussian


- s18
pinhole makes incoherent light spatially coherent
filter makes temporal coherent

omega = 2 pi mu

full wave half maximum (FWHW)


c = lambda mu
mu = c 1/lambda
d mu = c / lambda^2 d lambda

=> d mu = c d lambda / lambda_0^2

gaussian power spectrum
temporal coherence function
complex degree of tcf
coherence time

w-k theorem
-> the temporal coherence function (Gamma(tao))
 = fourier transform {gaussian function  / power spectrum density}

S(omega) is the gaussian function
gamma(tao) is the normalized fourier transformed gaussian

(note sigma_omege measures width of gaussian and thus fourier transform
 on gaussian has the property that narrow to broder and vice versa)

                              |reference meter
S(omega) -----     -----------|    -->

                           signal meters

when rm is close to sm, we get interference and can thus detect


tao_c -> coherece time (match resolution of imaging system)


- s5
s(omega) gaussian power omega
alpha/beta, alpha% signal goes up way...


phase shift: presents in crossput
(E'_R is throughput while E_R is crossput)


E_R(t) = ...
E_S(t + tao) = ... (electro field of sm) (these are complex numbers)

E_R and E_S differ in time (since rm and sm may differ in distance)

- s6
I_det(tao) is the detected intensity at time tao

R_R = r_R^2 (r_R electro field reflicity)

|E_R+E_S|^2 = (E_R + E_S)*(E_R + E_S)^* (complex conjugate)

  e^(i theta) + e^(i theta)^*
= e^(i theta) + e^-(i theta)
= 2cos theta
= 2 Re{e^i theta} (real part)
use this to simplify 

Gamma(z) / I_0 = gamma(z)

  Re{\gamma(tao)} = ... comes from s4
= Re{exp(i w_0 tao) exp(...)}
= cos(w_o tao) exp(-sigma_omega^2 tao^2 / 2)
= cos(...) exp(- (2 \sqrt(2ln2) / tao_i)^2 * tao^2 / 2)
= ...



tao(t) = 2 [Z_R - Z_S] / c  ( Z_R is position of rm which change)
                            ( Z_S sample position is fixed)
       = 2 [v_Rt - Z_S] / c

omega_0 tao = omega_0 2[v_Rt - Z_S]/c (signal bounce forth and back thus 2 times)
            = 2 pi mu_0 2[v_Rt - Z_S] / [lambda_0 mu_0]
            = 2 k_0 v_R t - 2k_0 Z_S (where k_0 = 2 pi / lambda_0)

- s8
dont care about DC, care about AC

all equations based on assumption that source is gaussian

delta z => axial resolution (mainly determined by bandwidth of source `delta lambda`)

- s9
Multiple sm

auto-correlation: interference signal come from sample itself not from RM which is not what we want

- s11

~ left three figures
RM match SM get signal
take absolute
(resolution depende on envelope of signal not freq)

broder spectrum, narrow gaussian -> high resolution

- s3
E(z,t) = A cos(kz - wt)
time domain OCT relies on wt
fourier domain OCT relies on kz (

delta z0 is distance diff between sample and ref.
This determines freq of sinusoidal func

- s4
ss: inside spectrum exists scanning device that decompose the the spectrum


- s5

- s6
fix ref (no distance change), detect diff in spectral domain

- s7

E_R/E_S electrical field
I_det interference want to observe

sample arm: multiple field in side sample thus need to sum
<>_t => detector detect signal within a time slot and average, thus no more time domain in fourier domain OCT equation
DC doesnt contribute to inferference
auto-correlation no reference involved

- s8

- s9
before and after fourier transform
power spectrum change to coherence function
multiplication change to convolution

- s11
if broad power spectrum, get narrow coherence function
which after convolving with ... contribute to narrow signal (figure)
and thus have high resolution

- s13
bottom figure: white below sinusoidal (blue) is DC part
               influence cleaniness 

- s14
artifacts happen when imaging high reflectivity sample

autocorrelation happens when lights from different layers of the sample interfere with each other
if we put ref further away from sample, we dont worry about this

- s15
however, if ref is too far, sensitivity is decreasing

sampling property of signal causes decrease of signal strength (sensitivity)

high freq sampling
        ^
        |
small width pixel (narrow rectangular func) -- fourier --> wide sync function -> dynamic range of image large

generally need high freq sampling (dataset however is big)

- s16
figure: peak in the middle: DC

positive side is exactly the same with negative side
if positive side is too close to DC, it may go over DC and overlap with negative side

this only happens in fourier domain not time domian

- s17

- s6
TD-oct: wave number (z <-> k)
FD-oct: wavelength

treat DC as constant
simulation ignore autocorrelation

- s7
when have meter at sample:

after increase DC, empty space below gaussian is DC part

initial 50um and thus have signal at 50um
as add DC, signal intensity get smaller

thus, need to balance power between sample and reference arm

- s10
as we add more alpha to gaussian spectrum, we end up with less wave number

- s11
broad band: wide gaussian (need this to get better resolution)
narrow band: narrow gaussian
bandwidth influence resolution

axial resolution: width of wavelength at half maximum
as we increase alpha, input spectra getting narrow, after FFT, output gets
broader and thus larger axial resolution

- s13
coherence imaging system: we care about phase (treat light as wave)
incohere imaging system (con-focal microscopy): treat light as photon, cannot extrat wave info

- s14
by taking absolute value, we get amplitude
by taking angle, we get phase info
phase: [-pi,pi], hard to see trend as it goes down and up
to see trend of phase, we do unwrapping

- s15
as distance between two arms increase (passlength difference), 
  freq of input fringe increase => fft output has intensity at higher freq

when there are multiple spectra, fft can resolve complex freq to simple intensity and thus can resolve multiple reflector

- s18
generally we place optics before sample arm and these will distort wave
however reference arm doesnt need any which makes the two different.
thus need to place something before ref arm as well to match

- s20
distorted frame: left part wave gets widers

- s21
2nd dispersion: fft still symmetric
after fft, output gets really broad, hurting axial resolution (energy distributed in spatial dim)

phase curve for 2nd order looks like 2nd order function

- s23
3rd dispersion: fft output not symmetric anymore

phase curve for 3rd order looks like 3rd order function

- s27
for dispersion broading, same amount happened to all signal
other issues that lead to broadening may not have this

- s29
fft pair z (fft domain) with k (wave number)
thus sample wavelength and get k = 2*pi / lambda

(if our sampled data is along wavenumber, data is linear, if we sample along wavelength nonlinear)

FD-OCT acquire signal corresponding to wavelength, which may not map exactly to wavenumber we sample
Before s29, everything is based on uniformly sampled k (linear k)

1st issue of k-nonlinear sampling: shape change

- s30
2st issue: fft output is not symmetric and get broader

- s32
broadening effect caused by non-linear sampling is getting more severe at high freq
while dispersion leads to same effects at all freqs

** Jan 26
- s35
phase shift between the two is pi/2
with a shift, signal is larger
maximize sensitivity

C = A + iB
  = D e^(i pi)

Real(C) = A, Imag(C) = B
Abs(C) = D, Ang(C) = pi

- s3

- s4
freq increase, signal away from DC


- s5
hilbert transform remove negative side (imaginary data) and increase amplitude of positive side.

- s6

- s7
binary window fringe (calibration raw data)
(similar to s14)

- s8
resample based on deviation of linear sample data from real freq
phase should be linear after resampling

k--fft-->z
^
lambda

actual data is lambda domain, convert to k domain, dont know how
thus use phase info to decide and sampling procedure is always non-linr

- s9
red is original power spectrm, bult is after it.

- s10
e.g. original 1024 sampling points, after fft, we end up with 512 points due to hilbert sampling.

axial resolution derive from equations
pixel resolution (two pixels apart, want to know distance between actual layers)
e.g.

Left figure
DC is at origin?, as we go away from DC, sharpness decreased

- s11
move reference arm 250um each time and see how much depth index change each time (e.g. 36)
then we know pixel resolution is 37?

- s12
two signals in left is same, mechanical issues cause shift

- s14
cplx_fft = (512,400)
complex_fft_data = A(x,y) e^(i pi(x,y))
cplx_fft_ref = cplx_fft(512,1)

if freq is same, complex conjugate multiplication should be zero in most part
not same here

e.g. c1 = a1 e^(i pi1), c2 = a2 e^(i pi2) ...
given three complex number, to measure phase diff (diff between pi1 pi2...)
we do c1 c2* (c1 times complex conjugate of c2)
and gets a1a2 e^(i (pi1-pi2))

- s15
after compensation,

Summary


Introduction
The introduction of the report should set the context for the level of observation conducted on the site visit. Include the importance of what is being observed and what you can learn from those observations. This might be, for example, to address a problem or provide a solution in another location.

Main body of report
monitor the operation of an optical imaging system.

Students will visit on sight of the multidisciplinary research environment of engineering and clinical studies. Multiple demonstration of optical imaging devices will be performed which will be summarized and reported by the students.

Two different groups will be organized for students: One group will be assigned to optical
microscopy system in an engineering laboratory and the other group will be assigned to clinical imaging trial in a clinic.

Conclusion / Recommendations / Reflections
In the final section, you should sum up the key findings from the site visit and comment on the implications of these findings, and you may also give recommendations if that is appropriate to the task.  If you are required to reflect on your experience, try and make connections between what you have observed at the site and what you have learned in your subject.
